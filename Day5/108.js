// JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

// An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line by line, translating it into machine code or intermediate code on-the-fly.
