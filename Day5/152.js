//  What is the need of tree shakingWhat is the need of tree shaking

// Reduced Bundle Size: Tree shaking helps in reducing the size of the JavaScript bundle that gets delivered to the browser. By removing unused code, only the necessary parts of the codebase are included, leading to faster download times and improved performance for web applications.

// Optimized Performance: Smaller bundles result in faster parsing and execution by the browser. This optimization is particularly critical for large-scale applications where minimizing load times and optimizing resource utilization are key performance considerations.

// Efficient Module Management: Tree shaking works efficiently with modular code, especially with tools like webpack and Rollup.js. It allows developers to use modular code organization without worrying about including unnecessary code in the final bundle.

// Improved Maintenance: By eliminating dead code automatically, tree shaking helps in maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. Developers can focus on writing modular and reusable code without concerns about unnecessary bloat in the production build.

// Better User Experience: Faster load times and optimized resource utilization translate to a better user experience. Users accessing web applications built with tree shaking experience quicker interactions and smoother navigation, enhancing overall satisfaction and engagement.
