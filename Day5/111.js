// What is JSON  -

// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
// JSON is an open standard data-interchange format.
// JSON is lightweight and self-describing.
// JSON originated from JavaScript.
// JSON is easy to read and write.
// JSON is language independent.
// JSON supports data structures such as arrays and objects.

// Features
// Simplicity
// Openness
// Self-Describing
// Internationalization
// Extensibility
// Interoperability

//  Why use
// Less Verbose: In contrast to XML, JSON follows a compact style to improve its users' readability. While working with a complex system, JSON tends to make substantial enhancements.
// Faster: The JSON parsing process is faster than that of the XML because the DOM manipulation library in XML requires extra memory for handling large XML files. However, JSON requires less data that ultimately results in reducing the cost and increasing the parsing speed.
// Readable: The JSON structure is easily readable and straightforward. Regardless of the programming language that you are using, you can easily map the domain objects.
// Structured Data: In JSON, a map data structure is used, whereas XML follows a tree structure. The key-value pairs limit the task but facilitate the predictive and easily understandable model.

//  JSON Objects -{"name" : "Jack", "employeeid" : 001, "present" : false}

// Json Array-
