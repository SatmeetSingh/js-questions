// Is it recommended to use eval

// Avoid using eval() for large or complex code: eval() is slow and can be difficult to debug, so it's generally recommended to avoid using it for large or complex code

// Terribly slow: the JavaScript language is designed to use the full gamut of JavaScript types (numbers, functions, objects, etc)â€¦ Not just strings! Using eval is orders of magnitude slower than normal JavaScript code.

// Malicious code: invoking eval can crash a computer. For example: if you use eval server-side and a mischievous user decides to use an infinite loop as their username.
