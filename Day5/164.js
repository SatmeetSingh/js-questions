// What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

// a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes o allow developers to inspect its state and behavior during execution.

// Inspection of Variables- Breakpoints enable developers to examine the values of variables and data structures at a specific point in the program's execution. This helps in understanding how data is manipulated and identifying any incorrect values.
// Step by step execution - Breakpoints allow developers to step through their code one line or statement at a time. This helps in tracing the flow of execution and identifying logical errors or unexpected behavior.
// Conditional Breakpoints- Developers can set breakpoints with conditions, so the program pauses only when certain conditions are met. This is useful for debugging specific scenarios or edge cases.
// Modification of  -while the program is paused at a breakpoint, developers can modify the code, such as changing variable values or inserting temporary logging statements.

// Error Investigation: Breakpoints are invaluable for investigating runtime errors or exceptions. They allow developers to pinpoint the exact location and circumstances leading to the error, aiding in effective troubleshooting and bug fixing.
