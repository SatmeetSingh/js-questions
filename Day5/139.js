// What is an app shell model

// App-shell is a term used in web development to describe the basic structure of a progressive web application.

// he minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework provides the foundation for building fast, responsive, and reliable web applications.

// The App Shell Model is a design pattern that keeps a web app's UI and data modules apart. Caching the user interface in this design may load content on the fly. This method is widely utilized in progressive web apps (PWAs) because of its many speed and user experience benefits

// Benifits
// Faster Load Times
// The user experience is enhanced by reducing the time it takes for the program to load for the first time due to caching the app shell. Users have come to anticipate instantaneous response times from online apps, and any lag in response time will likely be seen as unacceptable. The App Shell Model achieves this separation between the UI and content by rapidly caching and loading the UI.

// Enhanced Efficiency
// The app's shell is identical across all screens, so it can be readily improved for speed. Optimizing the app shell and boosting its speed is possible via lazy loading and code splitting by developers, and the end effect is enhanced load times and general user satisfaction.

// Improved Performance
// The app shell improves the user experience by allowing faster page loads and switching views by decoupling the UI from the actual app's content. When switching between pages or views, the user doesn't need to wait for the UI to load. As an alternative, the app shell is consistent and packs rapidly, making for a more delightful experience.

// Offline Capabilities
// Users will have a more consistent and dependable experience because of the app shell's ability to be cached and loaded even when not connected to the internet. Service Workers, a background-running JavaScript API, do this by snooping on network requests. Service Workers allow developers to cache assets and provide offline functionality, making the app shell and content accessible even when the user is not connected to the internet.

// Examples of the App Shell Model in JavaScript
// Google maps
// Twitter lite
// Uber
